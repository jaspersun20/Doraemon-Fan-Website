	<p>Purpose: The purpose of the site is to introduce my users the history, origin, characters, trivias, and the movies of Doraemon. In the home page, I’ll lead my audience through the history, origin, and the theme song of the Doraemon TV show so that they can roughly know what the cartoon is about. In the character page, I’ll lead my audience through the five major doraemon characters, including Nobita Nobi, Shizuka Minamoto, Suneo Honekawa, Takeshi Goda, and Doraemon. The users can click on the characters' pictures so that they can skip directly into the displayed character's introduction. In the trivia page, I’ll lead my audience through six of the most interest trivias of Doraemon TV show. The users can reveal the trivias through hovering the pictures. In the movies page, I’ll lead my audience through the 12 major doraemon movies that are published between 1982 and 2020. The movies are arranged chronologically.</p>
